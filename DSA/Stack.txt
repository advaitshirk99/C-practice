Stack:
1) Stack is a data structure which follows a particular order in which operations are performed.
2) The order may be LIFO(Last in First out) or FILO(First in Last out)
3) It contains only one pointer (called stack pointer) that points to the top of the stack.

Applications of stacks:
1) A Stack can be used for evaluating expressions consisting of operands and operators.
2) Stacks can be used for Backtracking, i.e., to check parenthesis matching in an expression.
3) To reverse data, for example a string or converting decimal to binary
