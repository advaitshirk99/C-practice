Priority Queues
1) Do not have specific ends
2) Removal of element only occurs according to the priority of that element.
3) Highest priority element is removed first

Normal Queues:
1) Have two ends, front and rear, which aid in insertion and removal operations
2) Follows the first in first out principle
3) Elements which are inserted first, are allowed to be removed first

Applications of Heaps:
1) Heap data structure is used in HeapSort algorithm
2) Operations such as insert and delete in Priority queues can be efficiently implemented using binary heaps
3) Heap implemented priority queues are implemented in graph algorithms, ex: Prim's algo
