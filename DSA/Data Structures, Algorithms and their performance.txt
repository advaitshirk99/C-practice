A) Data Structures:
    1) Data structures are storage structures used to store and organize data.
    2) It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.
    3) It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data.
    4) Data structures are of different types:
        i) Linear DS:
            a) Static: Arrays
            b) Dynamic: Stacks, Queques, Linked Lists
        ii) Non Linear DS:
            a) Tree
            b) Graph

B) Algorithms:
    1) An algorithm is a step by step procedure that is followed to solve a problem in finite steps.
    2) In other words, it is a set of finite well defined instructions written in human readable language to solve a given problem.
    3) There are various types of algorithms, such as:
        i) Sorting Algorithms,
        ii) Brute Force Algorithms,
        iii) Backtracking Algorithms,
        iv) Recursive Algorithms,
        v) Searching Algorithms

C) Performance of Algorithms:
    1) The performance of algorithms is defined by 2 factors: time and space complexity.
    2) Space complexity is defined as the amount of space required by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.
    3) Time Complexity is defined as the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.
    4) Space and time complexities are usually described using the Big Oh notation - O(f(input)), where as time complexity can also
       be described using the Big Omega or Big Theta notation.
