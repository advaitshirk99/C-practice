Q92, b) Job sequencing with deadlines

DESCRIPTION: Schedule the jobs using greedy approach which maximizes the profit
INPUT: 
J- Array of N jobs
D- Array of deadlines for each job
P- Array of profit associated with each job
OUTPUT: Set of scheduled jobs which gives maximum profit
J sorted in decreasing order of profit
S = 0 .....(Set of scheduled jobs)
SP = 0 .....(Sum of profits)

for i=1 to N do
    if job J[i] is feasible then
        schedule the job in the latest possible free slot meeting its deadlines
        S = S U J[i] ....(U: union)
        SP = SP +P[i]
    end
end

EXAMPLE: 
Let (P1, P2, P3, P4) = (100, 10, 15, 27); (d1, d2, d3, d4) = (2, 1, 2, 1)
total slots available = 2
Iteration 1:
S = {J1}
SP = {100}
Iteration 2:
S = {J4, J1}
SP = 100
Iteration 3 and 4: 
S = {J4, J1}
SP = 127
hence, final SP is 127 fro sequence J4, J1
