Algorithms:
1) An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure that is followed to solve a problem in finite steps.
2) In other words, it is a step by step or a set of finite well defined instructions written in human readable language to solve a given problem.
3) Examples of Algorithms : Sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, merge sort, radix sort
4) The 4 main criteria or guidelines that an algorithm should satisfy are:
    i) Finiteness: Algorithm should have finite number of steps and should end in finite time.
    ii) Input: An algorithm may have many inputs or no input at all
    iii) Output: It should result atleast one output.
    iv) Definiteness: Each step should be clear, and well defined. There should be no ambiguity
    v) Effectiveness: Each step must be simple and must take finite amount of time.
5) Example of an algorithm to find the sum of n elements:
    Step 1: START
    Step 2: Read input n from the user
    Step 3: Read n elements from the user
    Step 4: Declare sum as 0 and i as 0
    Step 5: Repeat steps 6-7 till i<n
    Step 6: Update sum as sum = sum + element at 'i'th position
    Step 7: Increment i
    Step 8: Print sum
    Step 9: STOP
